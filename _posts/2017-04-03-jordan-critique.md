For my critique I looked at the Tampa Bay Times [analysis of all police shootings from 2009 to 2014](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2017/investigations/florida-police-shootings/if-youre-black/). The story begins with short look at the background to the story, with the journalists claiming they were going to find out what is actually going on (maybe on overzealous claim). They begin by looking at all 827 shootings, but then immediately pare it down to black and white. Almost immediately you begin to see the numerical difference between black and white victims.

It seems to have a diverse intended audience, not just those who live in the Tampa Bay area. The data makes it extremely clear, and it also prevents you from having to read an article that would just list a bunch of numbers. I assume the reason I saw a lot of people sharing this article on twitter is because the graphics in this story are strong.

Some things they could improve is to demonstrate how they decide some of the more subjective aspects of the cases. To say that most Americans are black or white ignores a subjective reality about race, and in some cases I wondered whether they went by the eyewitness claims or the police record.

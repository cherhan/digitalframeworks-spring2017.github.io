For this assignment I looked at the [active fleet complement for the City of Seattle](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lSZ19wDfBUrkTpdKU2Pca_xBYHChpBfCuVtLP50bops/edit?usp=sharing). The data was most recently updated on March 30 and is refreshed monthly, so it seems to be a pretty active data set. The data set includes all types of vehicles, including boats, motorcycles and bicycles.

The data includes the date that each vehicle was introduced into the fleet. Sorting for that category shows that the oldest vehicles are two custom made barges from 1946, and then after that there are two tugboats from 1948. All four vehicles belong to Seattle City Light. But most vehicles are rather new, 102 being 2017 models and 1560 being less than 5 years old.

The city includes the cost that it has taken to keep each vehicle in service over the course of its use. At the low end, there are a number of things at $0 that are not usually repaired, like vehicle hitches and bicycle tires. There are three steel hull boats that have costed $20 million in maintenance each. This goes to show that if you were to base a larger story on this data you may need to do more research because this is probably an estimate (even if other values include information out to the cent). Of the 25 costliest to maintain vehicles all but two belong to the fire department, and most are firefighting barges or speciality rescue vehicles.

The city included an estimated date that the vehicle would need to be replaced. There could be some interesting implications in reporting because many of these vehicles are well past the date that they supposedly needed replacing. A number of cars are being used that are a few years out of date, but it may be worth considering if they are on the road because they lasted longer than anticipated or because they do not have the funds.There are some pumps, trailers and boats being used in public works that a two decades or more past that date. On the other end there are also quite a few barges and boats that will not be replaced for another generation, 2065 at the latest.

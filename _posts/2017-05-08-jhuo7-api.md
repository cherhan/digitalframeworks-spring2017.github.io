# API findings of World Bank's Financial Intermediary Funds

World Bank's Financial Intermediary Funds (FIFs) are formed from contributions of diverse state and non-states partners and are used to address development needs that are not addressed by existing funds and mechanisms. I examined its contributions from 1996-2013, as shown in its [database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g3MX_jLVbUgzaPt5rlhh2TZ0dQ2_ynPaWNtuSVs54To/edit?usp=sharing)

The Unites States is the largest FIF donor, having contributed $13.4 billion from 1996-2013, with a generally upwards trend.

The ten biggest donors are the US, the UK, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Norway, EC/EU, IBRD, and Sweden.

Notably, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ranks 15 in terms of total amounts donated, before Switzerland, Belgium, Finland, and the Russia. All of its donations are in health($675million) and agriculture & food security($183.7million).

In terms of sector, the United States has donated the most amount into health, followed by climate change and agriculture & food security.

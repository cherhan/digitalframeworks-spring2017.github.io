## Overview

TBD.

## Assignment

Read [A visual introduction to machine learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/).

TBD. Will be based on data from previous week's assignment though. Will also involve getting a full-stack set up on student systems.

## Lesson

TBD. Probably looking at lots and lots of data visualizations though.

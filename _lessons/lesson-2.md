## Overview

*Tools:* Google Sheets, Google search

*Concepts:* Spreadsheets, pivot tables, histograms.

*Philosophy:* Building data reflexes.

## Assignment

Find and "interview" a dataset. The Sunlight Foundation list of [US open data portals](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/opendata/blob/master/USlocalopendataportals.csv) is handy, if out of date. [Dataportals.org](http://dataportals.org/search) is annoyingly designed but also helpful. We'll discuss a bit more about how to find a good dataset in class.

Your analysis should:

* Use simple spreadsheet tools to identify maximum and minimum values for some numeric field type
* Use pivot tables to do basic data summaries based on a categorical field type
* Create some basic charts to help deepen understanding of the data

Your submission should be either a 2-4 minute video or a roughly 600-1,000 word written piece.

If submitting a video, embed the video in your post and submit that.

Whether submitting a video or a written post, you should create a publicly accessible Google spreadsheet with your analysis and link to it in the post body.
